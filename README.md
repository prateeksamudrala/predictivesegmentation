# predictivesegmentation
TLDR: A proof of concept project that explores creating new groups of segments (predicting segments) based on demographic and existing categorization

Not-TLDR:
Customer segmentation has been an age-old tool for all marketers. Segmentation allows for better data clarity for marketers to action on. Traditionally, segmentation has been feature-driven. Example: Grouping all potential customers within a certain age group, based on location, number of products purchased etc. This type of traditional segmentation is often referred to as Descriptive Segmentation 

While Descriptive Segmentation can allow for a certain level of targeted marketing, it does not provision for target marketing based on future behavior. For instance, perhaps a business would like to understand what type of product a certain group is more likely to purchase or what group is likely to churn or who is likely to be repeat customers. In short, Predictive Segmentation is a marketerâ€™s crystal ball. 

Predictive Segmentation can have a broad range of use cases; hence the research questions have to be dataset specific.

Our specific focus will be on predicting new groups of customers for an automobile company that is looking to venture into a new market.
